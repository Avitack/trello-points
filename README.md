# trello-points
Chrome extension for Trello, which provides functionality for assigning points to each task in a TODO list, which is used to track the total amount of points achieved.

Can be used as a way to prioritize tasks by assigning different points to each task.

# How to use:
This extension is intended to be used for a TODO type of board.
By default, the list that contains all the finished items should be named 'Done'.

<b>Assigning points to a task</b>
You assign points to a card by appending '(value)' in front of the task name. In Trello a task is called a 'Card'.
Example giving a Card a value of 20 points, by naming the Card:
  (20) Start using trello-points

<b>Finishing a task</b>
When you are finished with a task, you simple drag the Trello card over to the 'Done' list, which will then automatically count your points.
